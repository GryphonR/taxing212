# Taxing212
UK Capital Gains Calculator for Trading212

Functional site here: https://gryphonr.github.io/taxing212/

This started because Trading 212 don't give account statements that calculate gains and losses in accordance with UK Tax law - specifically the same day rule and the 30 day bed and breakfasting rule. 

If you find any issues or mistakes in the calculations please raise a github issue!

Aim: a simple to use website that converts the CSV trade history that Trading212 suplies into a useful tax year (and all time) overiew, providing all the information required for a Self Assessment form. These results may only be used for tax purposes after they has been checked for accuracy and completeness by yourself or your tax advisor.

Privacy - all calculation is done locally in the browser, no information leaves your computer. There are no ads or analytics.
