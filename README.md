# Taxing212
WORK IN PROGRESS - UK Capital Gains Calculator for Trading212

(Semi) Functional site here: https://gryphonr.github.io/taxing212/

This is very much a work in progress, started because Trading 212 don't give account statements that calculate gains and losses in accordance with UK Tax law - specifically the same day rule and the 30 day bed and breakfasting rule.

Aim: a simple to use website that converts the CSV trade history that Trading212 suplies into a useful tax year (and all time) overiew, providing all the information required for a Self Assessment form (However I'll emphasize that the results given from this site are assumed to be incorrect! - and certinaly are at the moment)

Privacy - all calculation is done locally in the browser, no information leaves your computer. There are no ads or analytics.
